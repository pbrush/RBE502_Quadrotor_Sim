# Quadrotor Simulator RBE 502

This repository contains a MATLAB simulation for a quadrotor. The simulation allows students to understand and experiment with quadcopter dynamics and control systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (R2020a or later recommended)

### Installation

1.unzip the quadrotoro_sim.zip file

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `quadrotor_simulator_matlab` directory.

### Running the Simulation

1. Run the simulator by typing `runsim` in the MATLAB command window.

### Implementing the PID Controller

Students are required to implement the PID controller in the `pid_controller.m` file. The PID controller will be used to control the quadrotor's attitude and altitude.
